This repository contains the *intended* sidrops draft defining
a human readable ASPA notation.

Note, check the ABNF grammer here:

We use the markdown document (.md) as the primary source, and
use the mktext_docker.sh script to generate xml and other
outputs locally and the .github workflow to create these files
in github.
