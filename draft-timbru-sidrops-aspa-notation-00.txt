                      Human Readable ASPA Notation
                 draft-timbru-sidrops-aspa-notation-00

Abstract

   This document defines a human readable ASPA notation for use with
   RPKI tooling.  The desire is that this will help create consistency
   across various tools, and thus support the principle of least
   surprise to operators.  That said, this definition is informational,
   and implementations can choose to use their own notation styles
   instead.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  ASPA Notation Definition

   This specification uses ABNF syntax specified in [RFC5234].

Internet-Draft                ASPA Notation                November 2021


   notation           = customer-as separator provider-as-set

   customer-as        = asn
   separator          = " => "
   provider-as-set    = empty-list / provider-list

   empty-list         = "<none>"
   provider-list      = provider-as *(provider-separator provider-as)
   provider-as        = asn / asn-v4 /asn-v6
   provider-separator = ", "

   asn              = 1*8DIGIT
   asn-v4           = asn "(v4)"
   asn-v6           = asn "(v6)"

2.1.  customer-as

   This field represents the customerASID defined in section 3.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile]

2.2.  provider-as-set

   This field represents the providerASSET defined in section 3.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].  For the moment we assume that
   version -07 of this document will allow the use of an explicit empty
   provider AS set, rather than using AS0 for this purpose.

2.2.1.  empty-list

   If an ASPA has no providers this is explicitly specified by using the
   value "<none>".

2.2.2.  provider-list

   If an ASPA has at least one provider then we need to specify them.
   I.e. we need to mention the first provider-as and, if applicable, all
   following provider-as values separated by a comma and space
   character.  Note that provider-as values MUST be sorted by their asn
   value.

2.2.3.  provider-as

   A provider-as can be an 'asn', 'asn-v4' or 'asn-v6'.  Note that the
   latter two options include an 'asn', but limit the scope of the
   provider to an address family, IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.  A
   specification MUST NOT contain more than one provider-as for the same
   'asn' - e.g. a provider cannot be defined without address family
   limit AND with such a limit.

2.3.  asn

   This represents the decimal value of a 32 bit Autonomous System
   Number.  Values MUST be part of the range 0-4294967295.

2.4.  asn-v4

   This represents a provider ASN which is authorised for IPv4 only.

2.5.  asn-v6

   This represents a provider ASN which is authorised for IPv6 only.

3.  Example Notations

   AS65000 => <none>
   AS65000 => AS65001
   AS65000 => AS65002(v4)
   AS65000 => AS65001, AS65002(v4), AS65003(v6)

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  Acknowledgements
