1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   This informational document defines a human readable ASPA notation
   for Validated ASPA Payloads (VAPs) [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].

   The main motivations for providing this notations style are: * This
   can help to create consistency between RPKI Relying Party software
   output, making it easier for operators to compare results. * This can
   be used by RPKI Certificate Authorities (CA) command line interfaces
   and/or configuration.  E.g. allowing a CA to provide a listing of
   intended VAPs which can be easily compared to RP output. * This can
   be used for documentation.

   That said, this definition is informational.  Implementations can
   choose to use their own notation styles instead of, or in addition to
   this.

3.  ASPA Notation Definition

   This specification uses ABNF syntax specified in [RFC5234].

Internet-Draft                ASPA Notation                     May 2023


   notation           = customer-asid separator providers
   customer-asid      = asn
   separator          = " => "
   providers          = provider-as *(provider-separator provider-as)
   provider-as        = asn / asn-limit-v4 / asn-limit-v6
   provider-separator = ", "
   uint32             = %d0-4294967295
   asn                = ["AS"] uint32
   asn-limit-v4       = asn "(v4)"
   asn-limit-v6       = asn "(v6)"

3.1.  customer-asid

   This field represents the customerASID defined in section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile]

3.2.  providers

   This field represents the providers defined in section 3.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].  Note that the constraints defined
   there are also applicable here.  In short:

   *  There MUST be at least one provider-as.

   *  The customer-asid "asn" value MUST NOT appear in any provider-as.

   *  The elements of providers MUST be ordered in ascending numerical
      order by the "asn" value of the provider-as field.

   *  Each "asn" MUST be unique.

3.2.1.  provider-as

   This field represents a ProviderAS as defined in section 3.3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].

   A ProviderAS in ASPA consists of a providerASID (section 3.3.1.1) and
   an optional afiLimit (section 3.3.1.2).  In the notation defined here
   we use a simple "asn" to represent a ProviderAS that has no afiLimit,
   we use "asn-limit-v4" to represent a ProviderAS with an afiLimit for
   IPv4, and we use "asn-limit-v4" to represent a ProviderAS with an
   afiLimit for IPv6.

   As mentioned earlier: the same "asn" MUST NOT appear more than once
   in the providers.  There is no point in listing the same "asn" with
   and without an afiLimit, as the entry without an afiLimit already
   encompassed the other.  Similarly, there is no point in listing the
   same "asn" with an IPv4 and an IPv6 limit, as this can and must be
   more concisely expressed as a single entry without an afiLimit.

3.3.  asn

   This field can optionally be prepended with the string "AS" followed
   by a decimal value of a 32 bit Autonomous System Number using the
   asplain presentation as specified in [RFC5396].  Decimal values MUST
   be used, and values MUST be part of the range 0-4294967295.

3.4.  asn-v4

   This represents a providerAS that uses an afiLimit for IPv4.

3.5.  asn-v6

   This represents a providerAS that uses an afiLimit for IPv6.

4.  Example Notations

   AS65000 => AS65001
   AS65000 => AS65002(v4)
   AS65000 => AS65001, AS65002(v4), AS65003(v6)

   65000 => 65001
   65000 => AS65002(v4)
   65000 => 65001, 65002(v4), 65003(v6)

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD

7.  Acknowledgements

   TBD

8.  Normative References
