                      Human Readable ASPA Notation
                 draft-timbru-sidrops-aspa-notation-01

Abstract

   This document defines a human readable notation for Validated ASPA
   Payloads (VAP, see ID-aspa-profile) for use with RPKI tooling based
   on ABNF (RFC 5234).

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   This informational document defines a human readable ASPA notation
   for Validated ASPA Payloads (VAPs) [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].

   The main motivations for providing this notations style are: * This
   can help to create consistency between RPKI Relying Party software
   output, making it easier for operators to compare results. * This can
   be used by RPKI Certificate Authorities (CA) command line interfaces
   and/or configuration.  E.g. allowing a CA to provide a listing of
   intended VAPs which can be easily compared to RP output. * This can
   be used for documentation.

   That said, this definition is informational.  Implementations can
   choose to use their own notation styles instead of, or in addition to
   this.

3.  ASPA Notation Definition

   This specification uses ABNF syntax specified in [RFC5234].

   notation           = customer-asid separator providers
   customer-asid      = asn
   separator          = " => "
   providers          = provider-as *(provider-separator provider-as)
   provider-as        = asn
   provider-separator = ", "
   asn                = ["AS"] uint32
   uint32             = %d0-4294967295

3.1.  customer-asid

   This field represents the customerASID defined in section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile]

3.2.  providers

   This field represents the providers defined in section 3.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].  Note that the normative constraints
   which are defined in that section mean that following :

   *  There must be at least one provider-as.

   *  The customer-asid "asn" value must not appear in any provider-as.

   *  The elements of providers must be ordered in ascending numerical
      order by the "asn" value of the provider-as field.

   *  Each "asn" value for used for a provider-as must be unique.

3.2.1.  provider-as

   This field represents a Provider AS as defined in section 3.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].

3.3.  asn

   This field can optionally be prepended with the string "AS" followed
   by a decimal value of a 32 bit Autonomous System Number using the
   asplain presentation as specified in [RFC5396].  Decimal values MUST
   be used, and values MUST be part of the range 0-4294967295.
